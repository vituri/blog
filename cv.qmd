## Work Experience

### R/Shiny Engineer  

***[Appsilon](https://www.appsilon.com/) (Remote)*** [Feb 2025 -- Present]{.cvdate}

Appsilon provides data science services to the biggest pharma companies in the world, focusing on R/Shiny and quick development.

- Contributed to [open source packages](https://github.com/Appsilon/ConnectUserMetrics) and collaborated with Posit to feature applications in the Connect Gallery.
- Delivered a proof-of-concept using AI/LLMs and R/Shiny, automating clinical trial data extraction and reducing processing time from weeks to hours.  
- Developed and maintained R/Shiny applications using Rhino; fixed issues and reviewed PRs for other open-source packages.
- Contributed to internal knowledge bases and authored [blog posts](https://www.appsilon.com/post/shiny-app-performance-fix).

### Head of Intelligence  

***[Argus Solutions](https://www.argusolutions.com.br/en-US)*** [Jan 2020 -- Jan 2025]{.cvdate}

Argus provides solutions for fatigue and distraction detection, control towers, and telemetry in transport operations around the world.

- Founded and led the Data team, growing it to over 12 members, including developers, data scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. Managed hiring, mentoring, and professional development for the team.
- Responsible for creating, testing and deploying 30+ R/Shiny applications for the entire company and clients, used by 300+ different users daily and 20+ users simultaneously. Some of these apps are used by the control tower 24/7 to analyze photos and videos.
- Automated the pipeline of data from hundreds of Excel files to a MariaDB database on AWS RDS, which has 10+ million new entries daily.
- Automated daily/weekly reporting with RMarkdown and Sendgrid, sending 10k+ emails monthly and saving over 20 hours of manual work daily.
- Developed a machine learning model to [predict driver drowsiness](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luis-torin-00641245_tecnologia-inteligaeanciaartificial-logaedstica-activity-7012149778255900672-Daed) with >80% accuracy on noisy data, using ensemble methods with [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/).  
- Created a high-performance Julia webserver using [Oxygen.jl](https://oxygenframework.github.io/Oxygen.jl/stable/), reducing data ingestion time from four minutes (with R) to five seconds (with Julia) per iteration.
- Led computer vision projects (cellphone detection, drowsiness, pothole, and gesture detection) using Keras and YOLO in Python.
